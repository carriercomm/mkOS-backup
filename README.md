mkOS-backup
===========

mkOS-backup is a fork of the Remastersys project (RIP). For now this repo holds the re-named and re-branded Remastersys source code just to keep the code alive. The plan for 2014 is a complete re-build that can be run from a liveCD/USB environment, keeping the RemSys ease of use but aiming to build clean images like one does using *bootstrap tools. Most probably there will be separate backup and dist apps, backup like it was and dist for building a clean distribution.
